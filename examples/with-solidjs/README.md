# Example: Use Lynx with SolidJS

This example shows how to use Lynx with SolidJS.

> [!CAUTION]
> Disclaimer: This framework is not currently officially supported by Lynx and cannot represent the actual performance, development experience, and user experience of Lynx. The integration of this framework may have some limitations or may change in future versions.
> The following code is for demonstration purposes only. It is not designed to be a complete framework. Its performance and compatibility cannot be guaranteed and should not be used in production.

## Produce a Lynx App Bundle (`.lynx.bundle`)

This is done by using `TemplateWebpackPlugin` and `EncodeWebpackPlugin` in your rspack configuration.

These plugins are provided by Lynx via npm package `@lynx-js/template-webpack-plugin`.

NOTE: You will need something like `MarkMainThreadWebpackPlugin` to mark assets (scripts) running on main thread by adding a `"lynx:main-thread": true` to the asset's info.

```js
/**
 * @param {import("@rspack/core").Compiler} compiler
 */
((compiler) => {
  compiler.hooks.thisCompilation.tap(
    "MarkMainThreadWebpackPlugin",
    /**
     * @param {import("@rspack/core").Compilation} compilation
     */
    (compilation) => {
      compilation.hooks.processAssets.tap(
        "MarkMainThreadWebpackPlugin",
        () => {
          const asset = compilation.getAsset(`main.js`);
          compilation.updateAsset(asset.name, asset.source, {
            ...asset.info,
            "lynx:main-thread": true,
          });
        },
      );
    },
  );
});
```

## Write a custom renderer

You can write a custom renderer for SolidJS (available since SolidJS 1.2.0, see [`Releases/1.2.0`](https://github.com/solidjs/solid/releases/tag/v1.2.0)). We can use Lynx's [Element PAPI](https://lynxjs.org/api/engine/element-api.html) to work with it. Here is an example (See packages/solid/src/index.ts for complete implementation):

```js
export const {
  render: _render,
  effect,
  memo,
  createComponent,
  createElement,
  createTextNode,
  insertNode,
  insert,
  spread,
  setProp,
  mergeProps,
} = createRenderer({
  createElement(tag) {
    return __CreateElement(tag, pageId!);
  },
  createTextNode(value) {
    return __CreateRawText(value);
  },
  replaceText(textNode, value) {
    __SetAttribute(textNode, "text", value);
    __FlushElementTree(textNode);
  },
  ...
});
```

## Use the custom renderer

We put the custom renderer into a workspace package `@lynx-js/solid` and you use it like this:

```tsx
import { createSignal } from "@lynx-js/solid";
...
```

But, you will need to config the `babel-preset-solid` to use the custom renderer:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/preset-solid",
      {
        "moduleName": "@lynx-js/solid",
        "generate": "universal"
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Build and Run

Now, build your app and run it:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

You will get a `.lynx.bundle` file in your output directory (the dist directory by default).

You can run this file using LynxExplorer.

## What to do next?

We have successfully integrated Lynx with SolidJS. But it is somehow a "single-thread" version. There are still some things you can do to take full advantage of Lynx:

1. Leverage [Lynx's Background Thread](https://lynxjs.org/guide/spec.html#background-scripting-thread-historically-known-as-js-thread).
   1. Support [Background Thread Event Handler](https://lynxjs.org/guide/spec.html#background-thread-event-handler).
   1. Move some part of SolidJS to the background thread to improve the performance.
   1. Automatically split user's code into main thread and background thread.
1. Support Lynx's `<list/>`. It is a virtualized list that can handle a large amount of data.
1. Do fast-refresh with rspack and [solid-refresh](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-refresh).
